# ⚠️ URGENT: Confluence Access Issue

**Date**: 2025-08-11  
**Status**: BLOCKED

## Problem Identified

The API token is authenticating correctly, but receiving:
```
"Current user not permitted to use Confluence"
```

This means:
- ✅ API token format is correct
- ✅ Authentication is working
- ❌ User `vincent@aimatrix.com` doesn't have Confluence access

## Solutions Required

### Option 1: Grant Access (Recommended)
1. Log into https://bigledger.atlassian.net as an admin
2. Go to Confluence → Settings → User Management
3. Add `vincent@aimatrix.com` with at least **Read** permissions
4. Or add the user to a group that has Confluence access

### Option 2: Use Different Credentials
Provide credentials for a user that has Confluence access:
- Different email address
- Associated API token

### Option 3: Manual Export
If API access isn't possible:
1. Export Confluence space as HTML/PDF
2. Share via Google Drive or similar
3. We'll convert to Markdown manually

### Option 4: Public Access
If the documentation is meant to be public:
1. Make the AKAUN space publicly viewable
2. We can scrape without authentication

## Action Required from Vincent

Please do ONE of the following:

```bash
# 1. After granting access, test with:
./venv/bin/python scripts/test-confluence-auth.py

# 2. Or update credentials with a user that has access:
vim ~/.aimatrix/credentials/atlassian-credentials.json

# 3. Or export manually and share the files
```

## While We Wait

I'll continue building the AIMatrix documentation (90% of content) without the BigLedger Confluence import. The structure is ready and we can add BigLedger content later.
