# ‚ö†Ô∏è Confluence API Access Blocked

**Date**: 2025-08-11  
**Status**: API access is blocked at the organization level

## Issue Identified

Your Atlassian account can access Confluence via browser but NOT via API because:
- ‚úÖ Tokens are valid and authenticating
- ‚úÖ You have Confluence access in browser
- ‚ùå API returns: "Current user not permitted to use Confluence"

This means your organization has **restricted API access** to Confluence.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Request API Access (Recommended)
Contact your Atlassian admin and request:
1. Enable API access for your account
2. Or create a service account with API permissions
3. Check if there's an "API Users" group you can join

### Option 2: Manual Export (Immediate Solution)
Since you have browser access:

1. **Go to Confluence** (in browser)
2. **Navigate to**: Space Settings ‚Üí Content Tools ‚Üí Export
3. **Export as**: HTML or XML (HTML is better)
4. **Download** the export file
5. **Share** the file with me via:
   - Upload to this repo
   - Google Drive link
   - Any file sharing service

I'll then convert it to Markdown automatically.

### Option 3: Use Confluence Export API
Some organizations allow export API even when regular API is blocked:
```bash
curl -u vincent@aimatrix.com:YOUR_TOKEN \
  "https://bigledger.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/content/export" \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"spaceKey":"AKAUN","exportType":"HTML"}'
```

### Option 4: Browser Extension
Use a browser extension to export:
- "Confluence Exporter" Chrome extension
- "Save Page WE" for full HTML export

## What I Need From You

Please do ONE of these:

### A. Export Manually (Fastest)
1. In Confluence, go to AKAUN space
2. Click Space Settings (bottom left)
3. Click "Content Tools"
4. Click "Export"
5. Choose "HTML Export"
6. Download and share the ZIP file

### B. Get API Access
1. Contact your Atlassian admin
2. Request API access for vincent@aimatrix.com
3. Or get credentials for an API-enabled account

### C. Copy Key Pages Manually
If export is not available, copy the most important pages:
1. Open each key page
2. Select all content (Ctrl+A)
3. Paste into text files
4. Share the files

## While We Wait

I'm continuing to build the AIMatrix documentation (90% of total):
- ‚úÖ AI Core Platform docs
- ‚úÖ Intelligent Automation docs
- ‚úÖ Quick Start guides
- üîÑ ML Platform docs (in progress)
- üîÑ Conversational AI docs (next)

The BigLedger content is only 10%, so we can add it later once we solve the access issue.

## Technical Details

The authentication is working (tokens are valid) but Atlassian is blocking at the application level. This is a common security practice where organizations:
- Allow browser access (for daily work)
- Block API access (for security)
- Require special permissions for automation

Your tokens are correct, your email is correct, but your account lacks API permissions.
