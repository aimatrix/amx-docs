```python
# Example Multi-Jurisdictional Compliance Mapping
class GlobalAIComplianceMapper:
    def __init__(self, business_locations, ai_applications):
        self.locations = business_locations
        self.ai_apps = ai_applications
        self.regulatory_matrix = self.build_compliance_matrix()
    
    def build_compliance_matrix(self):
        matrix = {}
        for location in self.locations:
            matrix[location] = {
                'primary_regulations': self.identify_primary_regulations(location),
                'sector_specific_rules': self.identify_sector_rules(location),
                'data_protection_laws': self.identify_data_laws(location),
                'emerging_requirements': self.track_emerging_requirements(location)
            }
        return matrix
    
    def assess_compliance_gaps(self, current_practices):
        gaps = {}
        for location, requirements in self.regulatory_matrix.items():
            gaps[location] = self.analyze_gaps(
                current_practices, requirements
            )
        return gaps
    
    def prioritize_compliance_efforts(self, gaps, business_impact):
        # Prioritize compliance efforts based on regulatory risk and business impact
        prioritized_actions = self.calculate_risk_weighted_priorities(
            gaps, business_impact
        )
        return prioritized_actions
```

        self.compliance_modules = {}
        
    def add_compliance_module(self, jurisdiction, module):
        """Add jurisdiction-specific compliance capabilities"""
        self.compliance_modules[jurisdiction] = module
        
    def configure_for_jurisdiction(self, jurisdiction):
        """Configure system for specific regulatory environment"""
        if jurisdiction in self.compliance_modules:
            compliance_config = self.compliance_modules[jurisdiction]
            return self.apply_compliance_configuration(compliance_config)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"No compliance module for {jurisdiction}")
    
    def apply_compliance_configuration(self, config):
        """Apply jurisdiction-specific compliance settings"""
        configured_system = self.base_system.copy()
        
        # Apply data handling requirements
        if config.get('data_localization'):
            configured_system.enable_data_localization(config['data_regions'])
            
        # Apply transparency requirements
        if config.get('explainability_required'):
            configured_system.enable_explainability(config['explanation_level'])
            
        # Apply bias testing requirements
        if config.get('bias_testing_required'):
            configured_system.enable_bias_monitoring(config['fairness_metrics'])
            
        return configured_system
```

        self.data_classification = self.establish_data_classification()
        self.transfer_mechanisms = self.setup_transfer_mechanisms()
        
    def establish_data_classification(self):
        """Classify data based on most restrictive jurisdiction requirements"""
        return {
            'public_data': {'restrictions': 'none', 'transfer_allowed': True},
            'business_data': {'restrictions': 'contractual', 'transfer_mechanisms': ['SCC', 'BCR']},
            'personal_data': {'restrictions': 'high', 'transfer_mechanisms': ['adequacy', 'SCC']},
            'sensitive_data': {'restrictions': 'very_high', 'localization_required': True}
        }
    
    def evaluate_data_transfer(self, data_type, source_jurisdiction, target_jurisdiction):
        """Evaluate if data transfer is permissible and required mechanisms"""
        classification = self.data_classification[data_type]
        
        if classification.get('localization_required'):
            return {'allowed': False, 'reason': 'localization_required'}
            
        transfer_assessment = self.assess_transfer_mechanisms(
            source_jurisdiction, target_jurisdiction, classification
        )
        
        return transfer_assessment
```
