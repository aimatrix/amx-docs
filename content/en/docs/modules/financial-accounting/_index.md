# Financial Accounting Module

## Overview

The BigLedger Financial Accounting module provides a comprehensive, standards-compliant accounting system designed for businesses of all sizes. Built with GAAP, IFRS, and local accounting standards in mind, it offers real-time financial insights while maintaining the rigor required for audit compliance.

## Core Concepts

### Double-Entry Accounting

BigLedger implements true double-entry bookkeeping where every transaction affects at least two accounts:

```
Debit Account A = Credit Account B

Example: Sale of $1,000
Debit: Accounts Receivable $1,000
Credit: Sales Revenue $1,000
```

```

## Best Practices

### Internal Controls

1. **Segregation of Duties**
   - Separate authorization, recording, custody
   - Maker-checker for critical transactions
   - Regular rotation of duties

2. **Approval Matrix**
   | Transaction Type | Amount | Approver |
   |-----------------|--------|----------|
   | Purchase Order | < $1,000 | Supervisor |
   | Purchase Order | < $10,000 | Manager |
   | Purchase Order | > $10,000 | Director |
   | Journal Entry | Any | Controller |
   | Payment | < $5,000 | AP Manager |
   | Payment | > $5,000 | CFO |

3. **Reconciliation Schedule**
   - Daily: Cash reconciliation
   - Weekly: Credit card reconciliation
   - Monthly: Bank reconciliation, AR/AP aging
   - Quarterly: Inter-company reconciliation
   - Annually: Full account reconciliation

### Performance Optimization

1. **Database Optimization**
   ```sql
   -- Index frequently queried columns
   CREATE INDEX idx_gl_date ON general_ledger(transaction_date);
   CREATE INDEX idx_gl_account ON general_ledger(account_code);
   
   -- Partition large tables
   ALTER TABLE general_ledger 
   PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(transaction_date));
   ```

2. **Archiving Strategy**
   - Archive transactions older than 7 years
   - Maintain summary data for reporting
   - Compress archived data

### Security Measures

1. **Access Control**
   - Role-based permissions
   - IP restrictions
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Session management

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Regular backups
   - Disaster recovery plan
   - GDPR/CCPA compliance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Out of balance | Missing journal entry leg | Review journal entries, ensure debits = credits |
| Reconciliation mismatch | Timing differences | Check outstanding items, adjust for timing |
| Report discrepancies | Incorrect mapping | Verify account mappings in report configuration |
| Performance issues | Large data volume | Implement archiving, optimize queries |
| Tax calculation errors | Outdated tax tables | Update tax configuration, verify rates |

### System Checks

```bash
# Daily health check
bigledger finance check --daily

# Validate trial balance
