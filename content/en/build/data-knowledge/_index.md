# AIMatrix Data & Knowledge Layer

The Data & Knowledge Layer forms the intelligent "brain" of the AIMatrix platform, providing sophisticated data management, knowledge representation, and ML/AI integration capabilities. This layer transforms raw data into actionable intelligence through advanced architectures and cutting-edge technologies.

## Architecture Overview

The Data & Knowledge Layer consists of five interconnected components:
