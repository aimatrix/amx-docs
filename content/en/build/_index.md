Learn how to build powerful applications, agents, and integrations with AIMatrix.

## Build Components

### [Agents](/build/agents/)
Create intelligent AI agents that can understand, reason, and act:
- Agent architecture and design patterns
- Creating custom agents
- Agent communication and coordination
- Advanced agent capabilities

### [Data & Knowledge](/build/data-knowledge/)
Manage and leverage data for intelligent applications:
- Knowledge management systems
- Data pipelines and processing
- Vector databases and embeddings
- RAG and GraphRAG implementations

### [Digital Twins](/build/digital-twins/)
Build intelligent digital representations of real-world systems:
- Digital twin architecture
- Real-time data synchronization
- Predictive analytics and simulation
- Integration with physical systems

### [Integrations](/build/integrations/)
Connect AIMatrix with external systems and platforms:
- Database integrations (Supabase)
- Authentication and authorization
- Real-time features and WebSockets
- Storage and CDN services

## Development Workflow

1. **Plan Your Architecture**
   - Define your use case and requirements
   - Choose appropriate components and patterns
   - Design data flows and integrations

2. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Install necessary tools and dependencies
   - Configure development settings
   - Set up testing and debugging

3. **Build and Test**
   - Implement core functionality
   - Add intelligent features
   - Test with real data and scenarios

4. **Deploy and Monitor**
   - Deploy to production environments
   - Monitor performance and usage
   - Iterate based on feedback

## Best Practices

- Start with core functionality before adding AI features
- Design for scalability from the beginning
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use version control for all components
- Test with realistic data and scenarios
- Monitor performance and user experience
