Multi-modal Large Language Models represent the next evolution in AI - systems that can understand and process multiple types of data simultaneously, just like humans do. This capability opens entirely new possibilities for business automation.

## What Are Multi-Modal LLMs?

### Beyond Text Understanding

Traditional LLMs only understand text. Multi-modal LLMs can process:

- **Text**: Documents, emails, messages
- **Images**: Photos, diagrams, charts, screenshots
- **Audio**: Voice, music, ambient sounds
- **Video**: Combined visual and audio streams
- **Documents**: PDFs with mixed content
- **Structured Data**: Tables, spreadsheets, databases

Think of it as giving AI human-like senses - the ability to see, hear, and read simultaneously.
