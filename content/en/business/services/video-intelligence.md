---

Video Intelligence Service transforms your organization's video content - meetings, training sessions, presentations, and more - into structured knowledge. Using cutting-edge multi-modal AI, we extract not just transcripts but actionable insights, decisions, and knowledge that would otherwise remain locked in hours of recordings.

## The Hidden Value in Your Videos

Organizations record thousands of hours of content yearly:
- 🎥 **Meeting recordings**: Decisions, action items, discussions
- 📚 **Training videos**: Procedures, best practices, expertise
- 🎤 **Presentations**: Strategic insights, project updates
- 📹 **Customer calls**: Feedback, requirements, issues
- 🎬 **Webinars**: Knowledge sharing, Q&A sessions

Yet 95% of this valuable content is never reviewed again.

## What is Video Intelligence?

Video Intelligence goes beyond simple transcription. It's a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process specifically designed for multimedia content:

    style M1 fill:#333,stroke:#00ff00
```

### Adaptive Model Selection

Our system intelligently routes content to the optimal model:

```python
def select_video_processing_pipeline(video_metadata):
    """Intelligent routing based on content type"""
    
    pipeline = {
        "audio": select_audio_model(video_metadata.audio_quality),
        "vision": select_vision_model(video_metadata.visual_content),
        "synthesis": select_synthesis_model(video_metadata.complexity)
    }
    
    # Example routing logic
    if video_metadata.type == "board_meeting":
        pipeline["audio"] = "whisper_large_v3"
        pipeline["vision"] = "gpt4_vision"  # For slides
        pipeline["synthesis"] = "claude3_opus"  # Best summaries
    
    elif video_metadata.type == "training_video":
        pipeline["audio"] = "whisper_medium"
        pipeline["vision"] = "custom_slide_extractor"
        pipeline["synthesis"] = "gpt4_structured"
    
    elif video_metadata.type == "customer_call":
        pipeline["audio"] = "whisper_with_denoise"
        pipeline["emotion"] = "emotion_analyzer"
        pipeline["synthesis"] = "sentiment_aware_model"
    
    return optimize_for_cost_quality(pipeline)
```

        self.correction_db.store({
            'original': original,
            'corrected': corrected,
            'context': context,
            'timestamp': now()
        })
