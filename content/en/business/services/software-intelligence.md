## Core Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Code Review

Beyond syntax - understanding business logic:

```python
class DomainAwareCodeReviewer:
    """AI code reviewer with business domain knowledge"""
    
    def __init__(self, knowledge_library):
        self.domain_knowledge = knowledge_library
        self.business_rules = self.extract_business_rules()
        self.compliance_requirements = self.load_compliance()
    
    async def review_code(self, pull_request):
        """Review code with domain understanding"""
        
        review = CodeReview()
        
        # Standard code quality checks
        review.add_checks(await self.check_code_quality(pull_request))
        
        # Domain-specific validation
        review.add_checks(await self.validate_business_logic(pull_request))
        
        # Compliance verification
        review.add_checks(await self.verify_compliance(pull_request))
        
        # Performance implications
        review.add_checks(await self.analyze_performance(pull_request))
        
        return review
    
    async def validate_business_logic(self, code):
        """Validate against business rules"""
        
        issues = []
        
        # Example: Invoice processing logic
        if "calculate_tax" in code:
            tax_rules = self.domain_knowledge.get("tax_calculation")
            
            # Check if implementation matches business rules
            if not self.matches_tax_rules(code, tax_rules):
                issues.append({
                    "severity": "high",
                    "line": self.find_line("calculate_tax"),
                    "message": "Tax calculation doesn't match business rules",

                    "documentation": tax_rules.reference_url
                })
        
        # Example: Customer discount logic
        if "apply_discount" in code:
            discount_policy = self.domain_knowledge.get("discount_policy")
            
            if not self.validates_discount_rules(code, discount_policy):
                issues.append({
                    "severity": "medium",
                    "message": "Discount logic violates business policy",
                    "details": "VIP customers should get 20% not 15%",
                    "reference": discount_policy.document
                })
        
        return issues

        # Generate happy path tests
        tests.extend(self.generate_happy_path_tests(domain_context))
        
        # Generate edge cases from domain knowledge
        tests.extend(self.generate_edge_cases(domain_context))
        
        # Generate compliance tests
        tests.extend(self.generate_compliance_tests(domain_context))
        
        # Generate integration tests
        tests.extend(self.generate_integration_tests(domain_context))
        
        return tests
    
    def generate_edge_cases(self, context):
        """Create tests for domain-specific edge cases"""
        
        # Example: Order processing system
        if context.domain == "order_processing":
            return [
                Test("Should handle order exceeding credit limit",
                     input={"amount": 100000, "customer": "standard"},
                     expected="credit_check_required"),
                
                Test("Should apply bulk discount for >100 items",

                     expected="15% discount applied"),
                
                Test("Should reject order from blacklisted country",
                     input={"country": "Restricted_Country"},
                     expected="order_rejected"),

### 3. Intelligent Issue Management

Transform how you handle GitHub/Jira issues:

```python
class IssueIntelligence:
    """AI-powered issue management"""
    
    def __init__(self, knowledge_library):
        self.knowledge = knowledge_library
        self.customer_context = CustomerKnowledge()

    async def process_issue(self, issue):
        """Intelligently process new issues"""
        
        # Understand the issue
        analysis = await self.analyze_issue(issue)
        
        # Enrich with domain knowledge
        enriched = await self.enrich_with_context(analysis)
        
        # Generate clarifying questions if needed
        if enriched.needs_clarification:
            questions = await self.generate_questions(enriched)

            questions = []
            
            # Use domain knowledge to ask relevant questions
            if "payment" in issue_analysis.keywords:
                payment_scenarios = self.knowledge.get("payment_flows")
                questions.append(

# Example Issue Processing:
"""
Issue #456: Payment failing for some customers

AI Analysis:
- Type: Customer-reported bug
- Domain: Payment processing
- Severity: High (affecting revenue)

Generated Questions:
1. Which payment gateway is affected? (Stripe/PayPal/Direct)
2. Is this happening for all card types or specific ones?
3. Error occurs at: [Authorization/Capture/Settlement]?
4. Approximate failure rate?

Suggested Investigation:
- Check payment gateway logs for error codes
- Review recent changes to payment module (PR #421)
- Similar issue resolved in ticket #234

Implementation Suggestion:
```python
# Add retry logic for transient failures
def process_payment(order):
    max_retries = 3
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            result = gateway.charge(order)
            if result.success:
                return result
        except TransientError as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```
"""
```

### 4. Developer Assistant Integration

Enhance IDEs with domain knowledge:

```python
class DeveloperAssistant:
    """In-IDE intelligent assistance"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge = DomainKnowledge()
        self.code_context = CodeContextAnalyzer()
    
    def provide_suggestions(self, cursor_context):
        """Real-time coding assistance"""
        
        # Understand what developer is working on
        context = self.code_context.analyze(cursor_context)
        
        suggestions = []
        
        # Suggest domain-appropriate implementations
        if context.implementing_new_feature:
            patterns = self.knowledge.get_patterns(context.feature_type)
            suggestions.extend(self.format_patterns(patterns))
        
        # Warn about domain violations
        if context.potential_violation:
            warnings = self.check_domain_rules(context.code)
            suggestions.extend(self.format_warnings(warnings))
        
        # Provide relevant examples
        examples = self.find_similar_implementations(context)
        suggestions.extend(self.format_examples(examples))
        
        return suggestions

# IDE Integration Example:
"""
Developer types: calculate_commission(

AI Suggestion Panel:
📚 Domain Knowledge:
- Commission rates vary by product category
- Special rules for enterprise customers
- Quarterly bonuses apply in Q4

📝 Implementation Pattern:
def calculate_commission(sale_amount, product_category, customer_type, quarter):
    base_rate = COMMISSION_RATES[product_category]
    
    # Enterprise customers have negotiated rates
    if customer_type == 'enterprise':

    # Q4 bonus applies
    if quarter == 4:
        base_rate *= 1.15
    
    return sale_amount * base_rate

⚠️ Common Mistakes:
- Don't forget to cap commission at $10,000
- Ensure audit trail for amounts >$1,000
- Check for commission holds/disputes
"""
```

    def validate_architecture(self, code_changes):
        violations = []
        
        # Check layering violations
        if self.crosses_layers(code_changes):
            violations.append({
                "type": "layering_violation",
                "message": "Direct database access from controller",
                "suggestion": "Use repository pattern"
            })
        
        # Check service boundaries
        if self.violates_boundaries(code_changes):
            violations.append({
                "type": "boundary_violation",
                "message": "Direct service-to-service database access",

            return Warning(
                "N+1 query pattern detected",
                "This will cause 100+ queries for typical page load",
                "Use eager loading: .include(:association)"
            )
        
        if analysis["api_impact"]["chatty_api"]:
            return Warning(
                "Multiple API calls in loop",
                "Consider batch API endpoint",
