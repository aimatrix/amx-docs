## Product Roles in Service Delivery

### AIMatrix CLI: The Developer Command Center

The CLI orchestrates the entire knowledge pipeline from the command line:

```bash
# Initialize knowledge processing environment
aimatrix init --project=customer-service

# Configure Knowledge Pipeline service
aimatrix pipeline create \
  --source=bigledger \
  --source=support-tickets \
  --source=call-recordings

# Deploy MCP server from knowledge
aimatrix mcp deploy \
  --knowledge=customer-service-library \
  --endpoint=api.company.com/support

# Push knowledge updates to Hub
aimatrix push --library=customer-service
```

**Service Integration:**
- **Knowledge Pipeline**: Configures data sources and processing rules
- **MCP Development**: Deploys intelligent API servers
- **Software Intelligence**: Integrates with CI/CD pipelines
- **AI Model Training**: Sets up training pipelines

### AMX Engine: The Processing Powerhouse

The Engine is where all heavy lifting happens, processing raw data into structured knowledge:

**Knowledge Creation Services:**
```yaml

  Input: Raw business documents, emails, PDFs
  Processing: Multi-modal LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
  Output: Knowledge capsules (200-600 tokens)
  
Video Intelligence:
  Input: Meeting recordings, training videos
  Processing: Whisper (audio), GPT-4V (visual)
  Output: Transcripts, summaries, action items

Data Hub Integration:
  Input: BigLedger ERP data
  Processing: ETL transformations, real-time sync
  Output: Structured data for agents
```

**Knowledge Activation Services:**
```yaml
MCP Server Hosting:
  Function: Run intelligent API endpoints
  Processing: RAG retrieval, guardrail validation
  Output: Grounded responses with citations

AI Model Training:
  Function: Fine-tune models on business data
  Processing: Custom training pipelines
  Output: Specialized business models

Digital Twin Simulation:
  Function: Business process modeling
  Processing: Kalasim discrete event simulation

```

### AMX Console: The Human Interface

Console provides universal access across all platforms with critical human-in-the-loop capabilities:

**Service Touch Points:**

| Service | Console Function | Human Role |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Knowledge Pipeline | Review low-confidence extractions | Validate/correct AI understanding |
| Video Intelligence | Verify meeting summaries | Confirm action items |
| Course Generation | Approve training content | Ensure accuracy and relevance |
| Content Publishing | Schedule and review posts | Maintain brand voice |
| Software Intelligence | Review code suggestions | Accept/reject changes |
| MCP Development | Test API responses | Verify answer accuracy |

**Multi-Channel Monitoring:**

```

### AMX Hub: The Collaboration Platform

Hub serves as the central repository and orchestration layer:

**Knowledge Management:**
```
Knowledge Artifacts Storage:
├── Capsules (Atomic Knowledge Units)
│   ├── Version control
│   ├── Metadata tracking
│   └── Access permissions
├── Volumes (Topic Collections)
│   ├── 10-20 capsules each
│   ├── Coherent narratives
│   └── Cross-references
└── Libraries (Complete Knowledge Bases)
    ├── Organized by domain
    ├── Full-text search
    └── API access
```

**Service Orchestration:**
- **Workspace Management**: Isolated environments for different projects
- **Webhook Reservoir**: Central integration point for external services
- **Engine Orchestration**: Spin up processing capacity on demand
- **Collaboration Tools**: Share knowledge across teams
