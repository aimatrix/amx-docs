    async def create_optimized_budget(self, historical_data, constraints):
        forecast = await self.ml_models['forecasting'].predict(historical_data)
        optimized_allocation = await self.ml_models['optimization'].optimize(
            forecast, constraints
        )
        scenarios = await self.scenario_planner.generate_scenarios(
            optimized_allocation
        )
        
        return {
            'budget': optimized_allocation,
