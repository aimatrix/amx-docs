        self.difficulty_adjuster = DifficultyAdjuster()
    
    async def generate_personalized_path(self, learner_id, learning_objectives):
        learner_profile = await self.learner_profiler.analyze_learner(learner_id)
        optimal_sequence = await self.path_generator.create_sequence(
            learning_objectives, learner_profile
        )
        
        for module in optimal_sequence:
            adapted_content = await self.content_optimizer.adapt_content(
                module, learner_profile
            )
            module.content = adapted_content
        
        return {
            'learning_path': optimal_sequence,
            'estimated_completion_time': self.estimate_completion_time(
                optimal_sequence, learner_profile
            ),
            'success_probability': await self.predict_success_rate(
