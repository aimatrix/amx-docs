## Code Example: API Integration

Want to integrate the agent with your own applications? Here's how:

```python
# Python example
import requests

# Your AIMatrix credentials
API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
AGENT_ID = "sales-insight-agent-001"

# Get latest predictions
response = requests.get(
    f"https://api.aimatrix.com/v1/agents/{AGENT_ID}/predictions",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}
)

predictions = response.json()
print(f"Next month revenue: ${predictions['revenue']:,.2f}")
print(f"Top opportunity: {predictions['top_opportunity']['name']}")
```

```javascript
// JavaScript example
const AIMatrix = require('@aimatrix/sdk');

const client = new AIMatrix({
    apiKey: 'your-api-key-here'
});

// Get agent insights
const insights = await client.agents
    .get('sales-insight-agent-001')
    .getInsights();

console.log(`Revenue forecast: $${insights.forecast.revenue}`);
