## The Traditional AI Implementation Challenge

### Why Most AI Projects Fail

Traditional AI implementations face critical obstacles:

- Application development: $100,000 - $1,000,000
- Data collection and analysis: $50,000 - $200,000
- Testing and optimization: $100,000 - $300,000
- Ongoing maintenance: $20,000 - $100,000/month

#### **Technical Complexity**
- Token management and optimization
- Model selection and evaluation
- Workflow design and implementation
- Integration with existing systems
- Performance monitoring and tuning

#### **High Risk**
- 70% of AI projects fail to deliver ROI
- Average 18-month implementation timeline
- Uncertain outcomes
