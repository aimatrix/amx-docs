- Gemini CLI (Google)
- Cursor AI CLI
- Angular CLI (ng)
- Gradle CLI
- Git command patterns

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### 1. Command Structure and Syntax Patterns

**Hierarchical Command Structure**
- Main command with subcommands: `amx <command> [subcommand] [options]`
- Support for abbreviated commands using unique prefixes
- Camel case patterns for complex abbreviations (e.g., `foBa` matches `fooBar`)
- Multi-project navigation with colon separators: `amx project:task`

**Convention Examples:**
```bash
# Claude CLI patterns
claude -p "task description" --allowedTools Edit Bash
claude --model claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Angular CLI patterns  
ng generate component my-component
ng build --prod
ng test --watch

# Gradle CLI patterns
gradle build
gradle lib:check
gradle clean build --parallel
```

**Recommended AIMatrix CLI Structure:**
```bash
amx init [project-name]                    # Initialize workspace
amx generate <type> <name>                 # Generate artifacts
amx deploy <target> [--env production]     # Deploy to environment
